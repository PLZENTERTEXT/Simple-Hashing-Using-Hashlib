# Simple-Hashing-Using-Hashlib

PROJECT 1 is to generate MD5 of string data

PROJECT 2 is to generate hashes of string data using 3 algorithms from hashlib library (MD5, SHA-256, SHA-512)

PROJECT 3 is to add salting and iterations to PROJECT 2
*You can choose how many iterations you would like to make as well :D

Note: This is just a small project of mine, the code is a bit messy so I apologise for that UwU
